Draft a SPEC.md for my existing project based on a short intake.

Ask me for exactly 12 high-leverage details (not obvious questions). After I answer, produce a complete SPEC.md in Markdown using a standard engineering spec format (overview, goals/non-goals, UX flows, requirements, data model, integrations, NFRs, edge cases, observability, rollout, risks, open questions, acceptance criteria).

If anything is unknown, make a clearly marked “Assumptions” section and list what you assumed.
Begin with your 12 questions now.
