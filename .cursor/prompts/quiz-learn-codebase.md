Read the codebase and @SPEC.md and then quiz me to ensure I understand it. Your goal is to reveal gaps and teach the correct mental model.

Ask non-obvious, repo-specific questions. After I answer:
- tell me whether I’m right
- show the relevant code locations (files/functions) that justify the answer
- explain the concept briefly
- give me a harder follow-up question or a practical “prove it” task

Cover architecture, runtime behavior, data flow, failure modes, security, performance, and deployment. Keep going until we’ve covered all major components. End with a study plan and a checklist of competencies I should be able to demonstrate.
